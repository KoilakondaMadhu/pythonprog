# Example 1:

# Input: routes = [[1,2,7],[3,6,7]], source = 1, target = 6
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The best strategy is take the first bus to the bus stop 7, then take the second bus to the bus stop 6.
# Example 2:

# Input: routes = [[7,12],[4,5,15],[6],[15,19],[9,12,13]], source = 15, target = 12
# Output: -1
